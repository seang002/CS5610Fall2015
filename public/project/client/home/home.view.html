            <p>Everyone knows a dog is a man's best friend. We love them, we care for them... they're basically like our family. But of course, sometimes work or play gets in the way and the dog is left home alone. But that's where we step in! Happy Paws is dedicated to make it quick and easy for you and your pup to find a dog walker nearby that you can book once, daily, or weekly! Sign up now and get started!</p>
            <p>No dog? No problem! Happy Paws is always looking for more dog walkers, so if you're interested, <a href="#/register">submit an application today!</a></p>
